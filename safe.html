Did you see what I did there? I tricked you into coming to this page by offering a misleading prompt, which normally wouldn't behave in this way on a "normal" website: Whether you pressed "Ok" or "cancel" you were led to this page via a concealed javascript redirect. If this link had sent you to a C2 (command and control) server, your machine may have downloaded malware or something else you don't want.
